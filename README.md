# Java Practice Exercises: Handling User Inputs and Loops

This repository contains several Java classes designed to practice handling user inputs and using loops to process and manipulate lists. Below are descriptions of what each class does along with instructions on how to run them and expected outputs.

## Exercises

### 1. Fifth Item

#### Description
Create a class called `FifthItem`. This class takes user inputs of strings until the user enters an empty string. Once an empty string is entered, the program will display the fifth string in the list and then terminate.

#### Usage
Run the `FifthItem` class. Input any number of strings, pressing enter after each one. To terminate the input sequence and see the result, simply press enter without typing anything.

#### Expected Output
The output will display the fifth string entered by the user. If fewer than five strings are entered, it will notify the user that there aren't enough inputs.

### 2. How Large

#### Description
Create a class called `HowLarge`. This class continuously accepts string inputs from the user until an empty string is entered. After that, it will display the size of the list of entered strings and then terminate.

#### Usage
Run the `HowLarge` class. Continuously input strings, pressing enter after each one. To end the sequence and get the size of the list, input an empty string by pressing enter directly.

#### Expected Output
The output will display the total number of strings entered by the user.

### 3. Last Item

#### Description
Create a class called `LastItem`. This class takes user inputs of strings until the user enters an empty string. Upon entering an empty string, it will display the last string entered before the empty string and then end the program.

#### Usage
Run the `LastItem` class and input strings, pressing enter after each entry. Enter an empty string to terminate the sequence and see the last entered string.

#### Expected Output
The output will display the last string that was entered by the user.

### 4. Index Of Integer

#### Description
Create a class called `IndexOfInteger` that accepts user inputs of integers until the user enters zero. After entering zero, the program will prompt the user to enter another integer and will then display the index of that integer in the list.

#### Usage
Run the `IndexOfInteger` class and input integers, pressing enter after each. Input zero to stop adding to the list. Then, input another integer to find its index in the list.

#### Expected Output
The output will display the index of the specified integer in the list. If the integer is not found, it will notify the user accordingly.

### 5. Sum Of List

#### Description
Create a class called `SumOfList` that takes user inputs of integers until the user enters zero. It sums all the entered integers and displays the total sum.

#### Usage
Run the `SumOfList` class. Input integers continuously, pressing enter after each. Enter zero to terminate the input sequence and display the sum of all entered integers.

#### Expected Output
The output will show the sum of all entered integers.

## Running the Programs
To run any of the programs, ensure Java is properly installed on your machine. Compile each class using `javac ClassName.java` and run it using `java ClassName`.
